@startuml Gateway and Identity Architecture

' Purpose: This diagram represents the security and access control layer of the system.
' It shows how the API Gateway manages all incoming requests and integrates with
' the Identity & Access Management service to ensure secure access to the platform.
' The architecture implements a robust authentication and authorization system,
' supporting both web and VR interfaces while maintaining centralized user management.

' External Systems
component "Web Frontend" as webUI
component "VR Frontend" as vrUI

' API Gateway
component "API Gateway" as gateway {
    port "auth" as gwAuth
    port "api" as gwApi
}

' Identity Services
component "Identity & Access Management" as iam {
    port "auth" as iamAuth
    port "user-mgmt" as iamUser
}

' Infrastructure Components
database "User DB" as userDB
queue "Identity Message Broker" as identityBroker

' Connections
